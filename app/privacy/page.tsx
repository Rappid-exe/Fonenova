/**
 * Privacy policy. Meta requires a public URL for it before the WhatsApp Business app
 * can be published, so this must stay a plain, login-free page that returns 200.
 *
 * The "website" and "cookies" sections describe what the site actually does, checked
 * against the source: the quote form only opens the visitor's own email app (nothing is
 * sent to a server), analytics is Vercel Web Analytics (cookieless), and the only thing
 * written to the browser is the light/dark choice in localStorage. If Google Analytics,
 * a newsletter, a chat widget or any other tracker is ever added, update those two
 * sections in the same change.
 *
 * The email address and company number come from lib/site.ts so this page follows them
 * if they change.

              <Term>Enquiry form.</Term> If you use the quote form, you enter your name, company name, email address,
              phone number (optional), product category, approximate quantity and any details you choose to add. The
              form does not send this information to our servers. When you press Send Enquiry it opens your own email
              app with a pre-filled message addressed to us, and we only receive it if you send that email. We use
              what you send to reply to your enquiry.

              describes it as anonymous: it does not use cookies, does not track you across other websites, and
              discards the visitor identifier after 24 hours.

        <Section title="Our WhatsApp receipts service">
          <P>
            We run a WhatsApp Business number used only by our own staff to submit business receipts, invoices, bank
            statements and currency exchange confirmations for bookkeeping. For this service we process the files and
            messages authorised staff send, their phone number and the time sent. Messages from anyone who isn&apos;t
            an authorised staff member are ignored and not stored. Files are stored in the company&apos;s private
            Microsoft OneDrive and processed by automated tools acting for the company, to record business expenses
            and VAT.
